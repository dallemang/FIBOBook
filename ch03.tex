\chapter{An Algorithm}
\label{ch03}

The navigation oriented heuristic ($h3$) considers the site topology.
Accesses to cached pages are not recorded in the
Web log due to the browser or proxy cache.
Therefore, references to those pages are missed.
The missing references in the log file can be found using a set of
assumptions.
The referrer field of the Web log or the Web site structure can be used
to infer cached pages.
If a requested Web page $p_i$ is not reachable
from previously visited pages in a
session, then a new session is constructed starting with page $p_i$.

\begin{algorithm}
\hrulefill

 \textit{Input :} Web server logs \newline
 \textit {Output :} set of user sessions
$\mathcal{S}=\{s_{1},...,s_{M}\}$

\hrulefill

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
 \STATE $\mathcal{S}=\{\emptyset\}$
 \STATE Order all Web logs by user IDs ($u_k$) and time increasingly
 \FORALL {user ID $u_k$}
    \STATE Create a new user session in $\mathcal{S}$ for user $u_k$
    \FOR {i=1 to the number of records of this $u_k$}
    	\IF {$t_{i+1} - t_i < \triangle t$}
    		\STATE insert this record into user session
    	\ELSE
    		\STATE Create a new user session in $\mathcal{S}$ for user $u_k$
    	\ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
 \ENDFOR
