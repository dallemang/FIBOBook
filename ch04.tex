\chapter{Shaded Areas}
\label{ch04}

M\&C provides a macro called \verb+mcframe+ that allows us to
create a frame around some text which automatically breaks its contents
across pages. 

\verb+\begin{mcframe}[width](text-width)<background-color>+\\

\ldots

\verb+\end{mcframe}+

The optional arguments are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\verb+width+ defaults to the width of the page
\item
\verb+text-width+ defaults to an indent of 10pt in each margin
\item
\verb+background-color+ defaults to the \verb+bluetwenty+ color of the
	M\&C books.
\end{itemize}

Here are a few examples using some text from the book \textit{General Game 
Playing} by M. Genesereth and M. Thielscher that was published by M\&C in 
March, 2014:

\begin{mcframe}
\verb+\begin{mcframe}+\\
Games of strategy, such as Chess, couple intellectual activity with
competition.
We can exercise and improve our intellectual skills by playing such games.
The competition adds excitement and allows us to
compare our skills to those of others.
The same motivation accounts for
interest in Computer Game Playing as a testbed for Artificial Intelligence.
Programs that think better should be able to win more
games, and so we can use competitions as an evaluation technique for
intelligent systems.

Unfortunately, building programs to play specific games has limited
value in AI.  (1)~To begin with, specialized game players are very narrow.
They can be good at one game but not another. Deep Blue may have beaten
the world Chess champion, but it has no clue how to play checkers.  (2)~A
second problem with specialized game playing systems is that they do only
part of the work. Most of the interesting analysis and design is done in
advance by their programmers. The systems themselves might as well be
tele-operated.

All is not lost. The idea of game playing can be used to good effect
to inspire and evaluate good work in Artificial Intelligence, but it
requires moving more of the design work to the computer itself.
This can be done by focussing attention on General Game Playing.\\
